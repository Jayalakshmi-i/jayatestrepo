## Project #1: Automated deployment of WAR File to Tomcat Server through CI/CD Pipeline
This project focuses on implementing a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like Git, Jenkins, Dockerfile, and Maven within the AWS Cloud environment. Configured Jenkins jobs to automatically trigger builds upon new code commits, build efficiently and deploy WAR files to a Tomcat server on EC2 instance, and consistently delivery to web applications.

## Project #2: Deploying our application securely in an Ec2 instance
This project demonstrates how to create a VPC to secure our application within a VPC so that we can use it for servers in a production environment.

To improve resiliency, deployed the servers in Two Availability Zones using an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer. For additional security, we deploy the servers in private subnets. The servers receive requests through the load balancer. The servers can connect to the internet by using a NAT gateway. To improve resiliency, we deploy the NAT in both availability zones.

## Project #3: Static website hosting on AWS using Terraform 

This project explains how to create an s3 bucket with all configurations and set a static website hosting to showcase a portfolio, projects, and resumes on AWS using Terraform.
With Terraform, we can automate the process of S3 bucket creation and configuration, defining the bucket policy to make our website accessible.

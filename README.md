## Project 1: Jenkins Pipeline for Java-based application using Maven, SonarQube, Argo CD, Helm, and Kubernetes

This project will automate the entire CI/CD process for a Java application  using Jenkins pipeline using Git, Sonarqube, Argo CD, and Kubernetes. Configured Jenkins Pipeline will monitor new code commits which triggers webhook to build and test the pipeline efficiently, then integrate with Sonaqube for code quality check, and finally deploy the Jave application on Kubernetes cluster using Argo CD server on website.

## Project 2: Deploying our application securely in an Ec2 instance

This project demonstrates how to create a VPC to secure our application within a VPC so that we can use it for servers in a production environment.

To improve resiliency, deployed the servers in Two Availability Zones using an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer. For additional security, we deploy the servers in private subnets. The servers receive requests through the load balancer. The servers can connect to the internet by using a NAT gateway. To improve resiliency, we deploy NAT in both availability zones.

## Project 3: Ultimate monitoring using Prometheus

In this project, I implemented a robust monitoring solution using Prometheus to ensure the reliability and performance of our infrastructure. The main objective was to set up real-time monitoring for a website and an EC2 instance, allowing us to address threats quickly and maintain optimal performance.

## Project 4: Automated deployment of WAR File to Tomcat Server through CI/CD Pipeline

This project focuses on implementing a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like Git, Jenkins, Dockerfile, and Maven within the AWS Cloud environment. Configured Jenkins jobs to automatically trigger builds upon new code commits, build efficiently and deploy WAR files to a Tomcat server on EC2 instance, and consistently delivery to web applications.

## Project 5: Static website hosting on AWS using Terraform 

This project explains how to create an s3 bucket with all configurations and set a static website hosting to showcase a portfolio, projects, and resumes on AWS using Terraform.
With Terraform, we can automate the process of S3 bucket creation and configuration, defining the bucket policy to make our website accessible.
